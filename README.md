> **Note**: I built this project as a quick weekend side project, so it's still a **work in progress**. I’ll be adding more features and fixing bugs. If you have any cool ideas, **feel free to contribute**. Let’s make this project awesome together!

## What’s MultiForge CLI?

**MultiForge CLI** is a powerful command-line tool for quickly building full-stack apps across multiple frameworks. With built-in templates, customizable workflows, and effortless package integration, it streamlines your development process and supports popular frameworks like Next.js (with more coming soon).

## Key Features (and what’s coming soon)

-   **Multi-Framework Support**: Currently supports **Next.js**, with plans to add **Remix** and **Laravel** soon, so you can easily switch between different frameworks for your projects.
-   **Effortless Package Integration**: Add important packages to your project and adjust them to match your coding style. Whether it's configurations or how things are set up, MultiForge adapts to the way you like to code.
-   **Templates**: Create your own templates or use built-in ones to kick-start your projects. You can also pull remote templates from GitHub or local directories, giving you flexibility in how you start your projects.
-   **Highly Customizable**: Full control over everything! Modify package setups, templates, and configurations to match your unique needs and workflow. MultiForge is designed to fit how you like to work.

## Supported Packages / Frameworks
